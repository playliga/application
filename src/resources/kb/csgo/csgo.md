# Enabling CS:GO Legacy Version

Counter-Strike 2 is missing many features that prevent you from playing your matches in-game. As a result, you'll need to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive again until CS2 supports these features.

> üìù Don't worry! You'll still be able to play CS2 even with CS:GO installed.

Right click on Counter-Strike 2 in your Steam library and click `Properties`.

When you're in properties, click on `Betas`.

Then click on the `Beta Participation` dropdown and select `csgo_legacy - Legacy Version of CS:GO`.

That's it! Steam will begin downloading CS:GO again.

When you want to play CS2 you'll launch it as usual from your Steam library.

Note that you'll be presented with a dialog window to choose between CS2 and CS:GO which can be disabled by toggling on the `Always use this option` check box.
